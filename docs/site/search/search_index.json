Structure The library is very flexible and interested users can develop custom function both in C++ and Python and utilize the core functionalities of SpLib. You can develop C++ codes in /csrc, and Python codes in /pysplib. Requirements C++ 11 or above Pybind11 Python 3.7 or above sudo permission is also required.
